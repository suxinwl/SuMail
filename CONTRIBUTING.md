## Version Management (版本管理)

### Version Number Location (版本号位置)

The version number is defined in `internal/config/config.go`:

```go
const Version = "v1.1.0"
```

### How Version Detection Works (版本检测原理)

1. **Current Version**: Read from `config.Version` constant
2. **Latest Version**: Fetched from GitHub API: `https://api.github.com/repos/1186258278/SuxinMail/releases/latest`
3. **Comparison**: Semantic versioning comparison (e.g., `v1.2.0` > `v1.1.0`)

### Releasing a New Version (发布新版本)

1. **Update version number** in `internal/config/config.go`:
   ```go
   const Version = "v1.2.0"  // Change this
   ```

2. **Commit and push** your changes

3. **Create a Git tag** matching the version:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.2.0
   git push origin v1.2.0
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions** will automatically:
   - Build binaries for Linux/macOS/Windows (amd64/arm64)
   - Create a GitHub Release with the tag
   - Upload compiled binaries and checksums

### Important Notes (注意事项)

- Version format must be `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
- Tag name must match the `Version` constant exactly
- GoReleaser config is in `.goreleaser.yaml`
- Online update feature downloads from GitHub Releases

## Styleguides

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Code Style

- We use standard Go formatting (`gofmt`).
- Please ensure your code passes `go vet` and `go lint`.
